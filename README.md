# Events App

This repository contains the code for the "Events App" developed as part of the recruiting task for Teclead Ventures. The application is built using React, Vite, and Ant Design.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShawnGB/5993b9ee-d880-4fe1-9491-2658a3a9891d
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd into foldet
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Task Requirements

### Technologies Used

- React
- Vite
- Ant Design
- TypeScript

### Data Source

The events data is fetched from the following API endpoint: [London Events API](https://teclead-ventures.github.io/data/london-events.json)

### Design

The design of the application should roughly follow the provided example. However, creative freedom is allowed, and Ant Design is used for UI components.

### Additional Functionality

1. **Sorting by Date:**

   - Events should be sorted by date as per the design mock. When the user scrolls down, the date should remain visible at the top.

2. **Shopping Cart:**

   - Clicking the "+" button should update the shopping cart icon at the top right, and the event should be removed from the list.
   - Clicking the shopping cart icon should display an overview of all events added to the cart.

3. **Google Maps Integration:**

   - Clicking on the location should open a new browser tab showing the Google Maps location.

4. **Search Functionality:**
   - Typing in the search field should filter events based on the input keyword in the title.

### Code Quality

- Ensure clean and well-documented code.
- Follow the principle of "Quality over Quantity."
- Utilize TypeScript throughout the project.
